# Wayfinder Save Editor

### MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR SAVE BEFORE USING IT!!!! I'm not responsible if this breaks your save

## Save files location

Save files are located at **%localappdata%/Wayfinder/Saved/SaveGames**

## How to use it

### BEFORE YOU EDIT YOUR SAVE

There's a known bug with certain languages with special characters where the save isn't encoded correctly and breaks. To avoid this, change your game language to **English** first and then edit your save. You are free to revert to the original language after you have done the edits.

Download and unzip the latest release at https://github.com/3nvy/wayfinder-save-editor/releases/latest

Then run the **Wayfinder - Save Editor.exe** file to start the save editor

Once booted, press the button to load the save file from the location above.

The save file you want to edit is usually the last modified one, but if you are in doubt, you can load the "\_Meta" file, and it will tell you which save file you need to load

## Steam Cloud Saves

Steam cloud saves are known for causing conflicts with the modified saves. If you are having issues editing your save, try disabling it.
