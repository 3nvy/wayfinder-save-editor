# Wayfinder Save Editor

### This tool is experimental, MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR SAVE BEFORE USING IT!!!! I'm not responsible if this breaks your save

You can download the latest version here

This is still experimental and very basic, but should provide the following:

## Manage Inventory Items: Currencies, Resources, Imbuements, Mounts (w/ Saddles), Housing Items & Awakening Stones

## Add Items from Founder's Catalogue

Mind this are only the items belonging to the founders pack, it doesn't include things like automatic attribution of Battle Tower rewards. That will come in a searate panel (see future updates)
