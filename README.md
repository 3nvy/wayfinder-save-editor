# Wayfinder Save Editor

### This tool is experimental, MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR SAVE BEFORE USING IT!!!! I'm not responsible if this breaks your save

You can download the latest version here

This is still experimental and very basic, but should provide the following:

# Edit existing fungible items
